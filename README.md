# HashMap Implementation

 A HashMap data structure implementation in Python that uses chaining for collisions. This project demonstrates data structure concepts and includes application through bird species observation tracking.

## Features

- Custom HashMap implementation with collision handling
- key-value storage
- Efficient lookup operations with O(1) average time complexity
- Error handling
- Testing with bird species observation data

Test Data
Includes a sample dataset (bird_observations_small.txt) for demonstration purposes.
